  			Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

      	<p class="details">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
      	code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
      	programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
      	theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
      	curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I 
      	never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team-project, in particular,
      	was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial
      	could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as
      	an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a 
      	job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% 
      	recommend!"</p>
